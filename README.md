# ***Horiseon Readme***

## Purpose

This repository is being used to develop the Horiseon website.
We are working on refactoring and making the website more streamlined and well as implementing best coding practices.  There was a lack of semantic html within the index file that we changed to more accessible tags.  Some of the challenges faced were keeping the layout and functionality of the website exactly the same.
